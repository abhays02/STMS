# Smart Traffic Management System for Emergency Vehicles üö¶

This project aims to address critical issues in modern traffic systems by introducing a **Smart Traffic Management System** designed to prioritize emergency vehicles such as ambulances and fire brigades. The system leverages traffic cameras and advanced algorithms to dynamically manage traffic lights based on real-time situations.

## üöß Problem Statement

The current issues are quite bothersome in a day-to-day life basis such as the time bound traffic lights which fail to recognise any sort of unprecedented movement or circumstance such as an accident or managing the traffic to make way for ambulances and fire brigades. Such unforeseen emergencies must be approached differently and hence only a single time bound code isn‚Äôt sufficient for the traffic system that we have today.
The current traffic management systems rely heavily on time-bound traffic lights, which fail to adapt to unforeseen circumstances such as:

- **Accidents**: Delays due to static traffic light cycles.
- **Emergency Vehicles**: Difficulty in creating a clear path for ambulances and fire brigades.

These challenges require a more adaptive and intelligent approach to traffic management.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

This system utilizes **traffic cameras** to monitor and analyze traffic flow in real-time. Based on the data, it dynamically adjusts traffic light signals to accommodate emergency scenarios effectively.
