#Smart Traffic Management for Emergency Vehicles.

The current issues are quite bothersome in a day-to-day life basis such as
the time bound traffic lights which fail to recognise any sort of
unprecedented movement or circumstance such as an accident or managing
the traffic to make way for ambulances and fire brigades. Such unforeseen
emergencies must be approached differently and hence only a single time
bound code isnâ€™t sufficient for the traffic system that we have today.
